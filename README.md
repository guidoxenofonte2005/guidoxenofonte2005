# Hey there! 👋
My name is Guido, a brazilian full stack developer.

I like to develop new and fun ideas based on topics I like, whether it's a new app/project for some specific purpose or just a fun project along with friends.

My main tech stack is Python and Flutter, but I also have experience using Java, Swift, C/C++ and GDScript, along with some SQL/NoSQL databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

I've got some public and other bunch of private projects, but the one I like the most is [Unnamed](https://github.com/guidoxenofonte2005/unnamed-CG-project)


**Fun facts about me**:
- I like music... a lot (I have a youtube channel named after me :D)
- I'm also a game developer in my free time, using the Godot game engine
- Hobbies: gym, game development, guitar/piano, singing
